When installing, if the module that was chosen for installation is on a host with a hostname in this directory, the hostname directory is checked for a file with the same name as the installed module. It can be more than one file, as long as they're grouped by hostname.

Whatever is in this hostname directory is then _CONCATENATED_ to the generated file, giving you overriding access to anything set in the desired module to be installed.
