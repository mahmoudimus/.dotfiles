modules:
- Allow sub-module folders to include separate files to concatenate all files inside a directory name and produce an output of the directory name as the resultant file
- Write a template parser that parses templates of files and substitutes specific lines of code for certain hosts
- Allow git repositories as dot file installables
- Allow host exclusions
- Installation instructions? Maybe have an install.py module in each one?

host hooks:
- Allow host hooks to prepend instead of simply concatenation
